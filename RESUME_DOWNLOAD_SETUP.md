```
Subject: Resume Downloaded - {{user_name}}

Hi Aditya,

Someone has downloaded your resume from your portfolio website.

Details:
- Name: {{user_name}}
- Email: {{user_email}}
- Download Date: {{download_date}}

Best regards,
Your Portfolio Website
```

4. **Get Your IDs**:

   - **Service ID**: Found in "Email Services" (e.g., "service_abc123")
   - **Template ID**: Found in "Email Templates" (e.g., "template_xyz789")

5. **Update the Code**:
   In `script.js`, replace these placeholders:
   ```javascript
   emailjs.init("YOUR_EMAILJS_USER_ID"); // Replace with your actual User ID
   emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', templateParams) // Replace with your actual IDs
